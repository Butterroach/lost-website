                Linux in Python and Qt 6.

                alt='Screenshot of Lost, showing a window
            with a UI. The action bar has two menus: Lost, and Help. Below it,
            there is a text bar with the url https://example.com/hosts.com, with
            an "Add" button to the right. Below, there is a list of
            hosts:
            https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/hosts/pro-compressed.txt
            (selected), and
            https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts.
            Below the list, there are 4 buttons. Going clockwise from top left:
            "Remove", "Update", "Update all", and
            "Save changes".'
            />
            <p>
                You can add hosts, update hosts, and remove hosts all in a nifty
                and easy-to-use UI.
